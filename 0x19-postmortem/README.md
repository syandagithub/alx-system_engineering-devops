Issue Summary:
•	Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on April 15th, 2024 (UTC).
•	Impact: The web application's login functionality was down, causing a 30% drop in user activity and resulting in frustrated users unable to access their accounts.
•	Root Cause: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service's database connection pool settings, leading to a bottleneck in handling login requests.
Timeline:
•	10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts showing increased response times for login requests.
•	10:05 AM: Engineering team alerted and began investigating.
•	10:15 AM: Assumed root cause to be a potential network issue due to recent infrastructure changes.
•	10:30 AM: Network team engaged to investigate network configurations.
•	11:00 AM: Network team confirmed no issues, leading back to application-level investigation.
•	11:15 AM: Discovered misconfigured database connection pool settings as the actual root cause.
•	11:30 AM: Incident escalated to database administrators for immediate resolution.
•	12:30 PM: Database connection pool settings adjusted and verified, resolving the issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings. The application's connection pool was set too low, causing a bottleneck during peak login times. This resulted in delayed or failed login attempts for users.
To resolve the issue, the database connection pool settings were adjusted to accommodate higher traffic loads during peak usage periods. Additionally, monitoring and alerting were enhanced to proactively detect and prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1.	Optimize Connection Pool Settings: Regularly review and optimize database connection pool settings to ensure they can handle peak traffic loads.
2.	Enhance Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring and alerting for key application functionalities, such as login services, to quickly detect and respond to performance issues.
3.	Automated Testing: Introduce automated testing for configuration changes to catch potential misconfigurations before they impact production systems.
4.	Documentation and Training: Document best practices for database connection pool configurations and conduct training sessions to ensure all team members are aware of proper configuration standards.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
1.	Patch application code to adjust database connection pool settings.
2.	Update monitoring and alerting thresholds for login services.
3.	Conduct a post-incident review with the engineering team to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement in incident response protocols.
